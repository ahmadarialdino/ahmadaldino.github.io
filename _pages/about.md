Ahmad Ari Aldino is an assistant professor at the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Sciences, [Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia](https://teknokrat.ac.id/). He received BSc and MSc in Mathematics from [Universitas Lampung](https://www.unila.ac.id/en/), Indonesia. Currently, he is the head of the Institute for Research and Community Service Universitas Teknokrat Indonesia. He is also a member of the Data Science Research Group, which aims to generate insights from data, allowing us to discover meaningful patterns and make predictions to support decision-making. His research interest includes Applied Statistics, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Image Processing.

Aldino is interested in the following research fields:
- Artificial Intelligence in Education
- Natural Language Processing
- Learning Analytics
- Educational Data Mining

In particular, Aldino aims to apply state-of-the-art language technologies to make use of the textual data collected in various educational settings (e.g., Q&A pairs in discussion forums, instructor-crafted feedback, and student-generated reflective statements) to construct a more inclusive learning environment. His research work is centered around two themes:

- Fairness, accountability, and transparency of Machine Learning techniques in education;
- Automatic collection and generation of quality educational materials (e.g., assessment questions and informative feedback).

For prospective students: I am always looking for self-motivated Bachelor students, who have a strong interest in research on technology-enhanced education, to work with me. Iâ€™m also happy to work with master and undergraduate students at Monash University. If you are interested, please contact me via aldino@teknokrat.ac.id.
